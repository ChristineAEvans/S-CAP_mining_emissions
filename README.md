## Description
These are sample [Google Earth Engine (GEE)](https://code.earthengine.google.com/) JavaScript scripts that supported the analysis: "Estimating Historic Carbon Emissions caused by Gold Mining Development throughout Southwest Ghana and the Southern Peruvian Amazon using S-CAP Approaches." This analysis was based on data from the [Radar Mining Monitoring platform](https://rami.servirglobal.net/) distributed by the Asociación para la Conservación de la Cuenca Amazónica [(ACCA)](https://acca.org.pe/) (access data [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/rami-alerts/alerts)), and data from the [Artisanal and Small Scale Gold Mining Monitoring Portal](https://ssmportal.cersgis.org/mining-portal) distributed by the Centre for Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Services [(CERSGIS)](https://cersgis.org/).

## Objectives
The main objective of this work was to estimate carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions caused by the conversion of forest and vegetation to mining pits. The specific geographies for this work were the Peruvian Amazon and southern Ghana.

## Context
These scripts were developed by the SERVIR Science Coordination Office for collaborative work done with the ACCA (based in Lima, Peru), and CERSGIS (based in Legon, Ghana). These scripts were written collaborately by [Christine Evans](https://github.com/ChristineAEvans) (NASA / UAH), and [Kaitlin Walker](https://github.com/katieailsa) (NASA / UAH), [Jacob Abramowitz](https://github.com/jabramowitz5) (NASA / UAH) and [Emil Cherrington](https://github.com/BzGEO) (NASA / UAH). 

## Methods
The methods used in scripts guided by the SERVIR CArbon Pilot project. The S-CAP web platform is currently housed at: https://s-cap.servirglobal.net. Also see https://github.com/ChristineAEvans/S_CAP_ProcessingScripts for additional information.
