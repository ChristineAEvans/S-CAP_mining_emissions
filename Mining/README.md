# S-CAP Mining Emissions Estimation
This folder contains Google Earth Engine (GEE) scripts to estimate aboveground carbon emissions from mining in Peru and Ghana, using methodology from the [SERVIR Carbon Pilot (S-CAP)](https://s-cap.servirglobal.net/) project.

These scripts were created by the [SERVIR](https://science.nasa.gov/category/missions/servir/) Science Coordination Office in 2024 to 2025 to support the estimation of carbon emissions from mining. This project uses data from the [Radar Mining Monitoring (RAMI)](https://rami.servirglobal.net/) project produced by Spatial Informatics Group (SIG), Amazon Conservation, SERVIR Amazonia, and Programa Nacional de Conservaci√≥n de Bosques; and from the [Artisinal and Small Scale Gold Mining Monitoring Platform](https://ssmportal.cersgis.org/mining-portal/) produced by the Centre for Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Services (CERSGIS) in Accra, Ghana.
